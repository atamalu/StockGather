### Financial Documents

`sec_financial_docs` returns the links for documents to download. If the
keyword does not return a page with the document links, the user is
provided with a prompt of options to choose from. Alternatively, you can
re-run the function using the desired company name acquired from the
printed list.

``` r
### Use name from 
financial.docs <- sec_financial_docs(company.keywords = 'apple inc', items.per.page = 10)
summary(financial.docs)
```

`download_sec_filings` downloads the documents whose info were acquired
using `sec_financial_docs` and stores them into the current working
directory

```
